# Processing Projects
GitHub repo where I keep my public Processing creations.

## What's Processing?
According to their website: Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

It has all the Java fundamentals but there aren't class structures, it's just one file.

Make sure to [check out the project](https://processing.org/)!

## p5.js
I also have a collection of my p5.js projects (Processing but for JavaScript) in [this repo](https://github.com/hugmanrique/P5Projects).
